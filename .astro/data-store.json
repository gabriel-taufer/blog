A monument of devotion, complexity, history, and size that you can see from kilometers away. I had seen videos. I had seen pictures. I *thought* I was prepared.\n\nBut nothing compares to standing in front of it.\n\nWe were driving our 5 meter-long rental van toward the city, when suddenly, there it was - the cathedral towering over every other building.\n\n**Massive.**  \n\nThe kind of massive that makes you ask yourself: *\"Why would humans build something like that?\"*\n\nAfter a long hunt for parking (turns out Cologne - as many other European cities - wasn't built for large vans), we started walking through the streets.\n\nAt first, you can't see it clearly - other buildings block your view. But then, as you get closer, the two front towers appear. Just the crosses at the top, at first. Then the details in the complex stonework. Then the full facade to the West of the cathedral.\n\nI stopped walking.\n\nI stood there.\n\nIt was the most **imposing** human-made structure I have ever seen. Not just because of the size - but because of what it *represents*.\n\n![A picture of the front of the Kölner Dom](@/assets/images/picture-of-kolner-dom.jpg)\n\u003Cfigcaption class=\"text-center text-sm text-gray-500 italic\">\nOne of the many pictures we took of the cathedral\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\nThe **Cologne Cathedral took 632 years to build.**  \n\nSix. Hundred. Thirty-two. Years.\n\nOver six centuries.\n\nConstruction began in 1248. It paused. It restarted. Generations passed. The world changed. But the vision lived.\n\nThey say it's still not finished - it never will be. Maintaining something like that requires constant attention and renovation. Parts break. The stones crack. \n\nTime does its magic.\n\nBut still, it stands - an eternal build.\n\n---\n\n![Cologne street scene, cathedral in the background](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Warning_sign_in_cologne.jpg)\n\u003Cfigcaption class=\"text-center text-sm text-gray-500 italic\">\nPhoto: \u003Ca href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Warning_sign_in_cologne.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Warning sign in Cologne\u003C/a>\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\nNow, I might not know the full story of the cathedral.  \nBut one question came to mind:\n\n> **How do you get human beings to work together across centuries to build something like this?**\n\nMaybe it was faith - shared belief that gave the work meaning.\n\nMaybe it was power - leaders trying to immortalize their legacy through stone and hard work.\n\nMaybe it was purpose - the desire to continue something others began, to honor a vision greater than yourself.\n\nI thought about it for days. Weeks.\nI even brought it up in therapy.\n\nAnd maybe that's why I'm writing about it now.\n\n---\n\nYou might ask:  \n**What does this have to do with tech? Or teams? Or building software?**\n\nI also asked myself that.\n\nAnd here's the thread I started pulling on:\n\n> **If humans can coordinate over centuries to build something like this...  \n> why does it feel so hard to get a product team aligned for six months?**\n\nI'm not being ironic. It's a genuine question.  \nWhy does collaboration feel this hard *now*, with all our tools, resources, and instant messaging?\n\nIs it just that physical structures engage people differently than digital ones?  \nOr is there something that can help people stay focused on a common goal - even when the people themselves change?\n\nI keep making this parallel to the cathedral: built by multiple generations of people, idealized over centuries, probably different from its original vision.\n\nBut it was built regardless.\n\n**It stands.**\n\nSo how do we get there?\n\nHow do we make sure that when a team has a goal - even when people come and go - the thing we're building still finds its way into the world?\n\nHow do we build software like we're building cathedrals?\n\nMaybe we don't.\n\n---\n\nThat day in Cologne, it was hot. The square in front of the cathedral was full of people.\nStreet musicians showcased their talents. People took photos, laughed, and searched for shade from the sun.\n\nLife was **flowing** around the cathedral.
