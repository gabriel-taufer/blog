My path in technology started by accident when I enrolled in a course at a local computer school in the town where I grew up - and live to this day.

The spark came after a presentation at my high school, where the speaker casually mentioned that people could "get rich" by creating vacuum robots that cleaned houses on their own. For some reason, that stuck with me. I couldn't stop thinking about how to build something like that.

That curiosity led me to my first robotics course, where I got hands-on experience combining programming with basic electronics and mechanical tinkering - wiring together Arduinos and writing C code I barely understood at the time.

From there, I discovered web development - Django, HTML5, and CSS - still at that same school. As much as I loved building physical things, I was also drawn to the secrets of the web â€” the idea that I could type something and instantly see it come to life in a browser

Before long, I found myself with the chance to work at a real tech company, building actual products with the skills I had picked up. I jumped at the opportunity. I had nothing to lose. I still remember my first contact with the production server, and I clearly remember clicking buttons I shouldn't click.

Since then, I've kept growing - working across different parts of the stack and exploring new challenges. I've built backend services, frontend interfaces, mobile apps, and data pipelines. I even dipped into data engineering, constructing ETL workflows. Eventually, this journey led me into a leadership role, guiding a development team at a startup - an experience that has taught me as much about people as it has about code.

Naturally, these experiences have shaped the way I think about software and programming as a whole. It's not just about writing code - it's about solving real problems, communicating clearly, making thoughtful tradeoffs, and building things that last. Alignment beats assumption, every time.

Until now, I've mostly kept that journey to myself, but something tells me it's time to start sharing - not because I have all the answers, but because learning is a constant process and stories like these might help someone else find their path.

*"Maybe it will be useful to someone out there."*
