My name is Gabriel - and this is where I write.

Whether it is about code, people, or the messy, fascinating space between the two - I try to share thoughts and ideas that were useful to me, hoping they will also be valuable to someone else too.

This wasn't my initial idea for the "branding" of this blog - quoted because I don't think the work I did fully qualifies as branding. But I wanted something more than a name that sounds like "John's Blog." - no offense to the Johns out there.

I wanted a space where I could be creative without being tied to technical jargon or professional wording. Something that fled the commonly used writing platforms. Despite using an existing framework, I wanted to give it character.

My character.

The first name was **"When Things Break"** - based on a belief I still hold: **that I've learned the most when something went wrong**. 

It was provoking, open to contemplation. But also, a bit generic.

Eventually it fell out of my liking. I wanted something less serious. More acid. More ironic - like my usual humor.

Then it came to mind: **"Poor Thoughts"**.

Often I catch myself with ideas that are hard to describe. I have to put them to paper in the most chaotic way possible - sometimes inventing words that don't exist or mixing multiple languages - then revise, again and again, until they start making sense to me.

Like carving wood into a sculpture.

That's the essence: raw thoughts, turned into something meaningful through iteration.

Poorly thought. Carefully written.

I've always liked this kind of humor. A bit of self-deprecation. Saying something more serious than it should be. A bit of Dwight Schrute energy - absurdities delivered with a straight face.

So it married perfectly: a style that's out of the ordinary, not for every audience - and my everyday humor, mixing seriousness with irony.
