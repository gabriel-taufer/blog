My name is Gabriel - and this is where I write.

Whether it is about code, people, or the messy, fascinating space between the two - I try to share thoughts and ideas that were useful to me, hoping they will also be valuable to someone else too.

The name **"When Things Break"** comes from a simple idea:
> I've learned the most - about systems, software, teams, and even myself - when something broke.

Bugs, outages, miscommunications, emotional burnouts, failed attemps... Those moments suck - but they're also where real insight happens. This blog is my way of capturing some of those turning points and making sense of them, in public, for the first time.

If you're looking for my portfolio/resume, head over to taufer.dev
 - that's where I showcase skills and a more professional overview of my career.

If you want to dig into the thoughts behind the work - the context, the stories, the breakage, and the recovery - you're in the right place.
